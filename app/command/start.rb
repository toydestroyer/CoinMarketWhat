        #{greetings}\\! Glad to have you here\\.

        This is an _inline_ bot, that aims to help you instantly share the price of Bitcoin, Dogecoin or any other cryptocurrency price with your friend or with a group\\.

        It's currently in *beta* so only *CoinGecko* and *Binance* are supported\\. More exchanges will be added soon, so let me know which one you want\\.

        By the way, if you have any feedback, send a message to the bot\\.

        Because this bot is mainly focused on inline features, you can't do much in this chat, but here's the list of commands available:

        /help â€” show "how to" gif
        /about â€” show this message again
        /donate â€” I think you know what this command does ðŸ˜‰

        Lastly, this is an [open source](https://github.com/toydestroyer/CoinMarketWhat) project and I'm not making any money from it \\(currently\\)\\. So if you really enjoy it, please consider to /donate

        Well, enough talking\\! Go ahead and start using the bot by clicking the "Try" button below\\.
